# Understanding the 2-Link 2D Forward Kinematics

## Overview

Kinematics is a crucial concept in robotics. It describes the **motion of objects without considering the forces** that cause the motion. When working with robotic arms, two main types of kinematics are essential:

- Forward Kinematics (FK):
  Given the joint angles, calculate the position of the end-effector (the "hand" of the robot).

- Inverse Kinematics (IK):
  Given the desired position of the end-effector, calculate the required joint angles.

## What I Learned

- Forward kinematics is the foundation of robotic arm control.
- By coding 2-link, 3-link, and even 4-link forward kinematics, I was able to clearly understand both the equations and the code implementation.
- I also experimented with 3D visualization to deepen my understanding.

## Python Practice

During the exercises, I improved my Python programming skills and explored important libraries such as:

- NumPy → for mathematical operations.
- Matplotlib → for plotting and visualizing robotic arm motion.
- Matplotlib Widgets (Slider)→ for interactive angle control.

## Key Takeaway

This practice helped me connect the mathematics of kinematics with practical coding, strengthening my understanding of how robotic arms are modeled and simulated.
