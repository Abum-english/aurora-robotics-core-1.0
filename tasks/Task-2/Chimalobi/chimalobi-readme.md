#Forward Kinematics
I have installed vs code and added python extensions

I didn't have a lot of errors runing the code though

I already have some basics of python covered as i was taking some python courses before the Robotics program began

Commenting on my version of the 2_links_2d.py was hard to do on my own but i did a little research (Google, Websites, Ai and what nots) and that helped a little

Through the commenting i understood that i didn't know python as well as i thought i did 

The first 30 lines were easy to comment on my basic knowledge on python helped and my little programming flow knowledge also helped as i was able to infer the meaning of some of the codes

I got a lot of confusion from line 31 below
 
I revisited the code and ran each line to truely understand what each code did and made new changes to my comments with the new knowledge gained
