## 📝 Task Instructions  

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Bakel-Bakel/aurora-robotics-core-1.0.git
   cd aurora-robotics-core-1.0
   ```

2. Create a new folder named your-name in `tasks/Task-2/`  
   - Copy `2_links_2d.py` into the `tasks/Task-2/your-name` folder. 
   - Rename it to `my-name-2_links_2d.py` 

3. **Comment the code**  
   - Add comments on **every line**.  
   - Provide additional insights if you wish.  

4. **Document your work**
