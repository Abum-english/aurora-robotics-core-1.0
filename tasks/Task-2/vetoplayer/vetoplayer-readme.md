I tried improving the cpp version of the solution as i want to improve my cpp skills during this bootcamp.

Major changes was the restructuring the codebase to a modern cpp strucuture and grouping related data.

The use of `struct` in strucutring datatypes and grouping realted data help improved the readability as well function separation of the foward kinematic logic into calculateEE to keep the main functionm from getting cluttered with math.
